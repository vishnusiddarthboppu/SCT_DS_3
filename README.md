# SCT_DS_3
# Bank Marketing Decision Tree Classifier

A machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a bank's term deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data using a Decision Tree Classifier.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer behavior in bank marketing campaigns. The model analyzes various customer attributes to determine the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit product.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build a robust classification model using decision trees
- Analyze customer demographics and behavioral patterns
- Provide insights for targeted marketing strategies
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Task**: Binary Classification
- **Target Variable**: `y` (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)
- **Features**: Customer demographics, campaign information, and economic indicators

**Key Features Include:**
- Age, job, marital status, education
- Default, housing loan, personal loan status
- Contact communication type, duration
- Campaign information (number of contacts, previous outcomes)
- Economic indicators (employment variation rate, consumer confidence index)

## ✨ Features

- **Decision Tree Implementation**: Uses scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical and numerical features
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive performance metrics including:
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
- **Reproducible Results**: Fixed random state for consistent results
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file operations

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-marketing-decision-tree.git
cd bank-marketing-decision-tree
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required packages:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place your training dataset as `training_dataset_03.csv`
   - Place your testing dataset as `testing_dataset_03_.csv`
   - Update file paths in the script if necessary

2. **Run the classifier:**
```bash
python bank_marketing_classifier.py
```

Or use the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook bank-marketing-decision-tree-classifier.ipynb
```

3. **View results:**
   The script will output:
   - Training progress
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix

## 📈 Model Performance

Based on the current implementation, the model achieves:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.90      0.84      0.87     11105
           1       0.09      0.15      0.11      1251

    accuracy                           0.77     12356
   macro avg       0.50      0.49      0.49     12356
weighted avg       0.82      0.77      0.79     12356
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Overall Accuracy**: 77%
- **Class 0 (No subscription)**: High precision (90%) and recall (84%)
- **Class 1 (Subscription)**: Low precision (9%) and recall (15%)

**Performance Analysis:**
The model shows high accuracy for predicting customers who won't subscribe but struggles with the minority class (subscribers). This suggests class imbalance issues that could be addressed with techniques like:
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling)
- Class weight balancing
- Ensemble methods
- Feature engineering

## 📊 Results

### Current Model Performance
- The model demonstrates strong performance for the majority class (non-subscribers)
- Class imbalance significantly affects minority class prediction
- Overall accuracy of 77% with room for improvement

### Potential Improvements
1. **Handle Class Imbalance**: Implement SMOTE or adjust class weights
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing data
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize tree depth, min_samples_leaf, etc.
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Try Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
5. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation
